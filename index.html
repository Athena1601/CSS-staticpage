      <h2>1. Get plenty of sleep</h2>
      <img class="sleep" src="sleep.jpg" style="height:400px; width:800px">
      <p>We spend about a third of our lives asleep. Sleep is important because it allows your body to rest and your mind to reset.</p>
      <p>Sleep is essential - It is as important to our bodies as eating, drinking and breathing, and is vital for maintaining good mental and physical health. Sleeping helps us to recover from mental as well as physical exertion. Sleep also has the ability to affect your mood. If you aren’t allowing yourself to get plenty of rest at night, you can easily become irritable, and your physical health may deteriorate along with your mental wellbeing. </p>

      <h2>2. Practice gratitude and stay positive</h2>
      <img class="gratitude" src="Gratitude.jpg" style="height:400px; width:800px">
      <p>Remembering that you have things to be thankful for in your life is just as important as eating healthy and exercising. Gratitude is an amazing way to have a positive mindset when life is getting you down. Set some time aside each day to think about the positives in your life, and write them down so you can refer back to them. Having a positive outlook on life, even in your darkest moments, can help your mental health immensely. </p>

		<h2>3. Eat healthy and exercise</h2>
				<img class="eat-healthy" src="eat-healthy.jpg" style="height:400px; width:800px">
		<p>“Good food has the power to cheer you up. All you need is a mix of different nutrients and in no time your mood will change! It also helps in overcoming depression”</p>
		<p>Eating properly is important for many reasons, but did you know it can really impact you mentally? By eating healthy foods that are full of vital nutrients, you increase your overall wellbeing and decrease anxiety and stress. Exercise goes hand-in-hand with eating healthy, as it can also improve your overall mood and fight anxiety and depression by releasing the feel-good hormones serotonin and dopamine.</p>

		<h2>4. Deep breathing </h2>
				<img class="deep-breath" src="deep-breath.jpg" style="height:400px; width:800px">
		<p>This is because when you breathe deeply, it sends a message to your brain to calm down and relax. The brain then sends this message to your body. Breathing exercises are a good way to relax, reduce tension, and relieve stress</p>
		<p>Have you ever noticed how you breathe when you feel relaxed? The next time you are relaxed, take a moment to notice how your body feels. Or think about how you breathe when you first wake up in the morning or just before you fall asleep. When your body is stressed you tend to have increased heart rate, fast breathing, and high blood pressure, all decrease as you breathe deeply to relax.

      The way you breathe affects your whole body. Breathing exercises are a good way to relax, reduce tension, and relieve stress.
      Breathing exercises are easy to learn. You can do them whenever you want, and you don't need any special tools or equipment to do them.</p>
